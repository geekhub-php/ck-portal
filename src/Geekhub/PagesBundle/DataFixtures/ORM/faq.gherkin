| Вопрос номер двадцать пять очень длинный в две строчки    | Will PhpStorm support XXXXX Framework/Technology? (PHP/JavaScript/anything else)  | Please NOTE When its stated that IDEA platform supports LANGUAGE (be it JS, PHP, Ruby, Java etc.) it means that IDE features will work with ANY valid code in that particular language and maybe even across them. However, SOME advanced features (i.e more smart completion) MAY require special handling of particular library/framework (i.e approach used to emulate object inheritance in JS). Libraries that are known to require such ADVANCED support of fine-grained features are mentioned in roadmap. All other stuff expected to work as is. |
